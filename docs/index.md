# Abstract

After indoor time increases, peopleâ€™s love for houseplants has blossomed, and hence it is no surprise to see indoor gardening continuing to surge in popularity. While some smart gadgets and devices were developed for improving the growth conditions for houseplants, they are limited in watering, soil moisture, and light monitoring, which require owners to take corresponding actions after they are informed. Therefore, in this project, an easier and smarter way of assisting houseplants seek sunlight is proposed and developed. We built an autonomous device with cameras, sensors, and motors that helps houseplants actively look for sunlight without the need of owners interfering. Even though limitations are realized at the late stage of the development process, most of the vital functionalities were fulfilled and shown to work as expected.
